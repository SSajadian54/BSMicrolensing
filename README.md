The C++ codes do Monte Carlo simulatiobns of binary-source (BS) microlensing events as they can be detected in the upcomming LSST and Roman observations. In thes simulations several second order efefcts were considered such as orbital motion of binary systems, finite-source size, blending effects. In each step, the codes make two files one for saving the model light curves and another one to save synthetic data points.  

The codes read some premade files and they can be shared upon request.  


Python files  generate  figures and calculate some  statistical parameters to evaluate the results and detectabuility of binary-source signals.  In thes codes, for each light curve the best-fitted ESPL models are specified.  

These codes are based on some python packages such as emcee, VBMicrolensing, Numpy, Matoplotlib. 


Some examples of simulated BS microlensing events are also attached.
